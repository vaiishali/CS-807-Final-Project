# CS-807-Final-Project

## Remotely monitored Soil Moisture Detection System

### Overview

This device detects humidity of the soil and then the data is sent to the server with the help of Wi-Fi module.
This data can then be accessed remotely from anywhere around the world.
It is perfect device to build an automatic watering system or smart garden where you can control your garden remotely.

Build Instructions
==================




Firmware Installation
=====================

To give instructions, Arduino IDE (Computer Application) is used to upload the code to the device.
The ESP8266 is connected to computer by a USB cable. <ESP8266WiFi.h> library is used to programm the device.



Usage
=====
This is usually where you tell the user how the device works. Do you just upload the software and flip a switch? What sort of things does this thing do? Are there alternate settings / modes / programs that might be good to mention. This is where you tell the user exactly how the device or program is used. For example: 

* Upload the code to the thing. 
* Turn the thing on. 
* The thing will do a thing and it'll be really cool. 
* Don't forget to feed the badgers!
